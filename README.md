# Project - Bank Account


The bank account application will allow users to create accounts to
withdraw money, deposit money, and make bill payments.
Users can use the application to practise simple banking and managing money.
This project is of interest to me because
personal banking is a major aspect of university life as students
often need to make many bill payments.
